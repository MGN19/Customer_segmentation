<h1>🧩 Customer Segmentation</h1>
<p>
    This project aimed to perform customer segmentation using two datasets containing information on customer demographics, spending habits, purchasing behavior, and transaction history. The identified customer segments were then used to develop targeted marketing strategies to maximize customer engagement and loyalty. This project was completed as part of the <strong>Machine Learning II</strong> course, focusing on unsupervised learning methods.

<h2>🚀 Project Steps</h2>

<h3>1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
    Understand the customer base through data exploration and visualization.
</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Explore and visualize the datasets to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between variables.</li>
    <li>Clean and preprocess the data for subsequent analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong><br>
    Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
</p>

<br>


<h3>2. 🔍 Customer Segmentation</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
    Identify distinct customer segments based on shared characteristics such as demographics, spending behavior, and purchasing patterns.
</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Apply unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customers into meaningful segments.</li>
    <li>Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each segment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong><br>
    Unsupervised learning techniques such as DBSCAN and K-means clustering.
</p>

<br>

<h3>3. 🎯 Targeted Promotions</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
    Develop personalized promotions for each customer segment to enhance customer engagement and loyalty.
</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Create marketing strategies tailored to the unique needs and preferences of each segment.</li>
    <li>Propose promotional campaigns based on customer behavior and purchase patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong><br>
Association rules to identify co-purchasing patterns and suggest targeted promotions.</p>
